# The RED & BLUE Game

**RED & BLUE** is a fast-paced head-to-head sabotaging game. Be the only one with a positive score to win.

The game is publicly hosted at: https://redblue.razvansauciuc.dev/

## The Origin

The project started with our internship at [ASSIST Software](https://assist-software.net/).

We've met their requirements and even added features ourselves. It was supposed to be a team project built that teached us different concepts related to front-end & back-end.

Things we learned while working on the project (only the front-end team):

- what is & how to work with ReactJS
- gained experience with working with an API and Websockets
- how to properly design an appealing UI
- how to work with TailwindCSS
- gained experience working with libraries (i.e. framer-motion, react-hot-toast)
- how to work collaboratively
